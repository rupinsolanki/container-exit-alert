# container-exit-alert
A script to check the container status and get email if it get stopped. 

For mailing our msg here I use the sendGrid api. 

You must create an account in sendgrid and setup the API key to use the mail service. 

To use the script :
  1) Clone the script and run the command "chmod +x <script-name>.sh"
  2) ./script_name :-> to run the script
